# Why Data Science?

Data Science is a combination of domain knowledge, programming and mathematics that enables us to make sense of data. The main goal of Data Science is to understand data, find some hidden relationships and build a model.

Data comes in different types and forms, therefore the first step is to collect and acquire your data. This can be either through going out to the field to collect the data you need, utilizing already existing datasets, scraping data from different sites and many more. After collecting data you then store in order to query it for future use.

**Real world data is messy.** Therefore, we will need to clean and prepare our data first before creating models. Additionally, using visualizations, we can gain deeper understanding of our data that will guide us in knowing the right variables to create our models.

> In this week, we will cover all this, using libraries such as *numpy*, *pandas*, *seaborn* and *matplotlib* to make sense of our data before we are able to create models.

## Week 2: self-study resources
This week we continue the journey with an introduction to Data Science, preparing your data and finally storytelling with Data using Visualization. Get Ready:
