 ## Setting up and Python Basics

 Welcome to week 1 summary for the #30daysOfDataScience. The week that was we covered Getting Started with Python with self-paced learning on Python Basics. As with every journey, the first step is ensuring you are well equipped. In the first live session, we covered how you can set up your local environment by installing [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download):
