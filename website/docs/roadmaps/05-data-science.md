# Roadmap

:::success #30DaysOf - Data Science
This 30Days Skilling content provides a guided tour of Data Science and Machine Learning in Python and Azure in four themed weeks.

 * Read the ['Kickoff'](#kickoff) section for more details.
 * Explore the linked resources each week to skill up!
:::


## Kickoff 
In the #30DaysOfDataScience we will go from understanding the Python language to working with real life data and finally creating Machine Learning models both on Azure and in Python. The main role is understanding our data and using the knowledge to make decisions such as clustering Nigerian music based on their 'danceability' score, 'acousticness', loudness, 'speechiness', popularity and energy.

## Week 1: Getting Started with Python
Python is one of the main programming languages used in Data Science. A major advantage of the language is its abundance of libraries which enable you to analyze your data with ease.

:::info WEEK 1 RESOURCES

## Week 2: Data Preparation and Visualization
Data Science is an intersection of domain knowledge, technical expertise, and statistics. It gives us the power to evaluate existing data, perform various functions such as visualization and manipulation which in turn help us in decision making.

## Week 3: Getting Started in Machine Learning
Machine learning is often the foundation for an AI system and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data. It automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data.
